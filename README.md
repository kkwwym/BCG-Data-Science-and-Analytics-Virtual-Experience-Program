# BCG-Data-Science-and-Analytics-Virtual-Experience-Program

This is a project I participated in BCG GAMMA online internship with their data scientist. We were asked for helping our client to develop a discount plan to avoid their customer churn.

The following steps are what we actually have done.

Unfortunately, I can't show the whole process of this project. But here I would like to share with you my experience and thoughts in doing this project and what learned from it.


Although this is an online internship project, there is still an opportunity to interact with BCG data scientists.  At the beginning, we need to send our ideas to the supervisor by email.
When I first proposed my idea, I didn't have data-driven thinking at that time, and then I received feedback from my supervisor and better methods. I re-studied the concept of product data analysis. Discovering the importance of domain knowledge is a very important part of the daily life of a data scientist. In addition to increasing my own hardware such as programming abilities, I also study the data metrics of various industries in different cases.
In the following process, I mainly used the functions written by the company to do data analysis. In this process, I also saw the power of writing functions, and felt that writing programs is no longer a matter of just talking on paper.
During the process of this project, I experienced the interactive relationship between the industry and data team.BCG is a consulting company based on data, and can get in touch with different kinds of customers. Our client  told us that their customers churn were lost quickly. They suffered from government policies. We use data thinking to suggest methods in a specific way and provide reference methods to retain customers.
